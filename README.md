## Project Portfolio
### NLP Reddit Classification
#### Problem Statement
After watching the US exit the World Cup, your American friends have decided to get into an argument at the cookout over what kind of sporting events they like to follow and why. Chief among their concerns is the question of which fandom is more annoying online - hockey fans or basketball fans. Naturally, each warring faction has decided to double down on the idea that it's actually the other fandom can stereotyped via their mannerisms, turns of phrase, and foolish notions of what makes for good sportsmanship.

You do not watch sports because you are a nerd and you like computers more, so you get a cheeky idea that is sure to annoy both sides. You tell them both fandoms are equally silly and simple-minded. Years from now, you will cringe at your use of the term "sportsball" and realize people don't talk to you at the water cooler because you're kind of tedious.

But today is not that day. You propose to write a computer program that takes training data in the form of Reddit forum posts corresponding to the NHL and the NBA, and you bet twenty dollars your computer program can correctly guess who wrote it - someone posting on r/NHL or someone posting on r/NBA. While your friends appreciate the awesome power of computers, they're not totally convinced that computers can process language in this specific way yet. What's your computer program going to do? Count words? Seems foolish.

### California Health Outcomes
#### Problem Statement
Pollution has long been known to have a causal effect on negative health outcomes. Our group's goal was to use various statistical hypothesis tests as well as exploratory data analysis and regression analysis to gain a stronger quantitative understanding of the effects of air pollution amongst the 58 counties of California.

### Energy Demand and Price Forecasting
#### Problem Statement
A private energy trading firm in Mexico wants you to make a model that predicts the price of energy.
The Mexican wholesale energy market is so new that the managing directors of the firm are convinced there are arbitrage opportunities to take advantage of.
But in order to fully take advantage of them, they need better estimates than those of their competitors.
